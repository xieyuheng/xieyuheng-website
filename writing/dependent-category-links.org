  - operad :

    morphisms that have multiple sources
    (multiple targets are easy to encode using products).
    It’s called an operad.

  - monoidal category

    This looks more like a combination of composition and tensoring,
    in a monoidal category.
    Based on some stuff in a blog post :

    - https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2017/11/the_polycategory_of_multivaria.html

    the cut rule is instead composition in a polycategory,
    and you can only cut out one type at a time.
