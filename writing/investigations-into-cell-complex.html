<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>Just like Aristotle, I start by history reviews and critiques.</p></li>

<li><p><p></p><p>The axioms of topological space is motivated by</p><p>the arithmetization of infinitesimal analysis {<a href="#org3b35579">1</a>}.</p><p></p></p><p></p><p><p></p><p>The axioms thus developed, capture the concept of nearness,</p><p>the first impressive use of the axioms is the definition of continuity.</p><p></p></p></li>

<li><p>Based on cell complex, I show another list of axioms,</p><p>to capture the concept of connectedness first,</p><p>and firstly use it to give an alternative definition of continuity.</p></li>

<li><p>This approach can be traced back to Aristotle,</p><p>in part six of his "Categories" {<a href="#org2626d86">2</a>}.</p></li>

<li><p><p></p><p>The aim of Algebraic topology is to develop functors</p><p>to distinguish topological spaces.</p><p></p></p><p></p><p><p></p><p>The functors developed often approach this aim</p><p>by using algebraic structures to express connectedness.</p><p></p></p><p></p><p><p></p><p>Thus my design is practical for algebraic topology.</p><p></p></p></li></ul>

<li><p><a id="org2626d86"></a></p><p>{2} Categories, By Aristotle, Translated by E. M. Edghill</p><p></p><p><ul class="org-ul"></p><p><li><p>Quantity is either discrete or continuous. Moreover, some quantities</p><p>are such that each part of the whole has a relative position to the</p><p>other parts: others have within them no such relation of part to part.</p></li></p><p></p><p><li><p>Instances of discrete quantities are number and speech;</p><p>of continuous, lines, surfaces, solids,</p><p>and, besides these, time and place.</p></li></p><p></p><p><li><p>In the case of the parts of a number, there is no common boundary</p><p>at which they join. For example: two fives make ten, but the two fives</p><p>have no common boundary, but are separate; the parts three and seven</p><p>also do not join at any boundary. Nor, to generalize, would it ever</p><p>be possible in the case of number that there should be a common boundary</p><p>among the parts; they are always separate. Number, therefore, is a</p><p>discrete quantity.</p></li></p><p></p><p><li><p>The same is true of speech. That speech is a quantity is evident:</p><p>for it is measured in long and short syllables. I mean here that speech</p><p>which is vocal. Moreover, it is a discrete quantity for its parts</p><p>have no common boundary. There is no common boundary at which the</p><p>syllables join, but each is separate and distinct from the rest.</p></li></p><p></p><p><li><p>A line, on the other hand, is a continuous quantity, for it is possible</p><p>to find a common boundary at which its parts join. In the case of</p><p>the line, this common boundary is the point; in the case of the plane,</p><p>it is the line: for the parts of the plane have also a common boundary.</p><p>Similarly you can find a common boundary in the case of the parts</p><p>of a solid, namely either a line or a plane.</p></li></p><p></p><p><li><p>Space and time also belong to this class of quantities. Time, past,</p><p>present, and future, forms a continuous whole. Space, likewise, is</p><p>a continuous quantity; for the parts of a solid occupy a certain space,</p><p>and these have a common boundary; it follows that the parts of space</p><p>also, which are occupied by the parts of the solid, have the same</p><p>common boundary as the parts of the solid. Thus, not only time, but</p><p>space also, is a continuous quantity, for its parts have a common</p><p>boundary.</p></li></ul></p></li></ul>
